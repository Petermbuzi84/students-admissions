# students-admissions
The project is a computer program that gets the list of primary pupils who have just finished their primary education and want to join high school. The list if in excel form and contains the details such as the name, index number and primary school they attended. The program takes the details of each pupil and generates a unique admission letter with the details filled in and saves the letter as a word document to be printed later. Once generated, the program begins to print each admission letter one at a time. The project is a small part of a project whose end goal is to be a management system for the school, including handling student details, staff and tracking inventory among other management tasks.
